Here are the steps I took to develop Cabrooks Film and Photography's web site.

Step 1: Established connection with client. After initial questioning through text. I was able to make a video call in which we talked in detail about the product the client would like.

Step 2: Created a repository on github to maintain version control and redundancy.

Step 3: Initialized NPM package file and downloaded necessary packages for project.
